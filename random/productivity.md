# Productivity

Use a few simple techniques:

1. Focus on ONE thing. Block your time in the calendar for everything and try to focus on the current task only.
2. Use 3:3:3 Plan. 3 hours to work on your most important projects. 3 hours for shorter tasks. 3 hours for maintenance activities.
3. Use a deep work practice, for at least 4 hours per day, with no distractions (use airplane mode on your phone).
4. When learning something new, apply the Feynman Technique. Pick a subject, attempt to explain it to a 5-year-old, then do more research to fill in any knowledge gaps.
5. Organize your duties according to an Eisenhower Matrix. The aim is to spend more time on vital tasks that advance your long-term values, missions, goals, and principles.
6. Processing messages and emails in bulk during one to three condensed times during the day.
7. If you want to improve in something, do it for 20 minutes per day. After a year, you will be better than 90% of people.
8. Use the Getting Things Done methodology to track everything you do efficiently.
9. Use Zero Inbox Policy. Get rid of unnecessary emails immediately. If the email requires someone else's attention, forward it. If an email takes less than a few minutes to reply, do it directly; otherwise, schedule a time to deal with it.
10. Beat procrastination with Pomodoro. Choose a task, set a timer for 25 minutes and work on it without distractions, take a short break, and do it again. After 4 sessions, take a more extended break.
11. Create yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals and plans. With the goal, you will probably get nowhere.
12. Do daily and weekly reviews. Ask yourself: "What did I do today that was aligned with my goals?" "Can I improve something?"
13. Learn to say NO to many things! One no is yes to many other things.
14. Walk 30 minutes every evening. Even better, do a walking meditation during this time.
15. Automate everything you can. Try to use different tools to automate everything you can, especially repetitive tasks.
